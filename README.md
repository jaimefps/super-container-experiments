# react-redux-tutorial

how i'd explain react + redux to someone


# basic workflow set up

0. npm install -S redux react-redux —> & create folder structure: actions, components, containers, reducers.
1. do all stuff related to Provider, createStore, and allReducers etc. as seen in the index.js entry point file.
2. create the index.js in the reducer folder, and create a dummy reducer file.
3. make container that connects component to the Store-state, and check to see if the component can log the state.
4. create some action that interacts with the state.
5. celebrate: you just build a react-redux environment from scratch.
